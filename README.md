Batch Map Processing Softeare for Horiba LabSpec6 adquisition software

This software is designed to process square/rectangular maps generated by the adquisition of Raman spectra in the Horiba LabSpec6 adquisition software.

It allows for simultaneous processing of different maps, but which all share the same frequency range for the spectra.

The input files must be the .txt files of the maps.

This software has implementations to cut the frequency range of the maps, to shift the frequency or intensity to correct miscalibrations, to subtract baseline as linear interpolation between anchor points and to fit each spectra of the map using the fit of the average spectra as a template.
